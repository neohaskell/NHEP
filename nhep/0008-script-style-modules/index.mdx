## Introduction

Haskell doesn't allow writing code directly in a file, with the intent of running it as a script.
Similarly to Java, Rust or C, it forces the user to put the code that is going to be run in a `main` function.

Contrary to Java or the others, the syntax is extremely useful for scripts, as it is expressive and concise.
There are solutions like `runhaskell` that allow you to run a Haskell file that defines a `main` function,
and users are already using it for scripts. For example, the widely used library [ghc-lib uses it for their CI/CD processes](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghc-lib/blob/master/CI.hs).

## Possible Implementation

Imports would be parsed and put at the top level, the rest would be inside of a `main` function. The users would have to run the module's `main` function explicitly, so there are no unexpected side effects on imports.

### Example with no exports

```haskell
module MyScript where

import File

foo <- File.read "foo.txt"

myFunction :: Int -> String
myFunction n =
  Int.toString n + foo
```

This would be compiled to:

```haskell
module MyScript where

import File

main = do
  foo <- File.read "foo.txt"

  myFunction :: Int -> String
  myFunction n =
    Int.toString n + foo

  pass    -- This is a function that does nothing but is required to make the main function valid
```

### Example with exports

The complexity is exporting symbols. If one would want to export some kind of function or data type from this kind of module, those would have to be put at the top level, which means that they wouldn't be allowed to use stuff from the scope they're defined with. E.g.

```haskell
module MyScript (myFunction) where

import File

foo <- File.read "foo.txt"

myFunction :: Int -> String
myFunction n =
  Int.toString n + foo
```

This would be compiled to:

```haskell
module MyScript (myFunction, main) where

import File

myFunction :: Int -> String
myFunction n =
  Int.toString n + foo     -- Woops, foo is not defined!

main = do
  foo <- File.read "foo.txt"
  pass
```

A solution would be to have a compile-time marker that marks the function as reexported in a script-style module, and if it has a `<symbol>  is not in scope` error, tell that it is not allowed to do that kind of stuff because it is introducing side effects, and we would direct the user to the proper documentation that explains why not.

Another solution, which is a double-edged blade, is to do some symbol tracking and if the function has to be reexported to the top level, we create a top-level mutable reference that:

1. Is **NOT** reexported
2. Is initialized in `main`
3. The function does an unsafe read of the mutable reference, using that value.

This has the problem that if `main` hasn't been called, this would fail in runtime.

A naive solution would be to introduce a runtime check, but that would make the code slower, and we'd introduce a
runtime error that would be hard to debug, which goes against the principles of NeoHaskell.

A possibility would be to have another compile-time check, that would disallow the usage of the function if the
`main` function of that module hasn't been called yet. Still, that is a complex task to implement, as we'd have to
figure out a way to track that, especially when branching is introduced, or even when concurrency is at play.

## Impact on Principle of Least Astonishment

Most languages nowadays allow writing scripts directly in a file, so it would not be surprising for users to be able to do that in NeoHaskell.

On the other hand, having the separation between the import and the module initialization is something not common at
all in other languages, so it is a very alien thing unless we manage to find a way to make it more familiar.

A possibility here could be that script-style modules are not allowed to export anything, as they are scripts,
meant to be run directly, and not imported.

Also, another possibility would be to have main to return a record of functions, as scripts do not return anything.
(They can print stuff, and write to files, but they do not return anything, apart from an exit code).

This could introduce a powerful tool for defining services, as the service initialization would be done in the main
function and the service would be returned as a record of functions, which would be the API of the service:

```haskell
module ProductService (
  count,
  deleteById
) where

import File
import Env

dbFile <- Env.get "DB_FILE"
          |> orElse "db.sqlite"

tableName <- Env.get "TABLE_NAME"
             |> orElse "products"

db <- File.read dbFile

count :: IO Int
count = ...

deleteById :: UUID -> IO
deleteById id = ...
```

If we wrapped everything into a function named `init` making it compile to the following, it would enable
a very interesting pattern for defining services:

```haskell
module ProductService (
  count,
  deleteById
) where

data ProductService = ProductService {
  count :: IO Int,
  deleteById :: UUID -> IO
}

init :: IO ProductService
init = do
  dbFile <- Env.get "DB_FILE"
            |> orElse "db.sqlite"

  tableName <- Env.get "TABLE_NAME"
               |> orElse "products"

  db <- File.read dbFile

  count :: IO Int
  count = ...

  deleteById :: UUID -> IO
  deleteById id = ...

  yield ProductService {
    count,
    deleteById,
  }
```

So now, some code that would use this service could do the following:

```haskell
import ProductService

main = do
  product <- ProductService.init
  totalProducts <- product.count
  print (Int.toString totalProducts)
```

Perhaps, at this point, it'd make sense to introduce a new keyword for defining services, instead of
relying on `module`? Maybe `service`?

```haskell
service ProductService (
  count,
  deleteById
) where

-- and so on...
```

## Impact on Principle of Developer Happiness

Many technologies allow the use of the same language as a way of configuring the application/project, for example,
in Ruby they use the language itself to define project dependencies or even the specification of the project.
[Here's the gemspec file of Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/rails.gemspec).

On the other hand, instead of writing scripts with Bash, Python or Ruby, one could use NeoHaskell, which is a much
more powerful language, and it would allow the user to use the same language for everything. Nowadays, people
are using Python in an "explorative" manner, where they write scripts and keep tweaking them until they get the
desired result, and then they put that into their application.

## Impact on Principle of Least Effort

This removes the necessity of having to write a `main` function, which is a very small thing, but it is still
something that the user has to do, and it is not something that is needed in other languages.

On the other hand, this does introduce many implementation tasks in the NeoHaskell codebase, so it is not something
that can be done in a short amount of time.
